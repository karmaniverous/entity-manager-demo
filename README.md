# Entity Manager Demo 

[**Entity Manager**](https://karmanivero.us/projects/entity-manager/) implements rational indexing & cross-shard querying at scale in your [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database so you can focus on your application logic.

This repository presents a working demonstration of **Entity Manager** in action. See [the companion article](/projects/entity-manager/demo/) for a detailed explanation!
